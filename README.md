# Annual-Class-schedule

you will develop a prototype for an adaptable user interface of an annual class schedule application that provides similar functionality as the one available on the university’s website.
Adaptable user interfaces offer to users the capability to select different presentation and interaction characteristics among the ones built into the application. 

Adaptability is based on user characteristics and preferences that are known prior to interaction and are assumed to remain static throughout a single interaction session. Compared with the “one size fits all” approach, adaptable user interfaces promise better user experience.
Users of an annual class schedule application have different objectives when they use the application. Freshmen and sophomores usually focus their attention on the general education requirements. It would be more effective for them to use if the user interface allows them to search by categories of relevant classes as shown in Quick Guide at www.gvsu.edu/gened/handbook-and-quick-guides-179.htm. On the other hand, search by discipline as the one on the university’s website would be more appropriate for other students since classes in their majors are their primary concerns. In addition, the administrative staff often searches information about classes based on non-academic considerations such as instructors, rooms, buildings, facilities, availability, and so on.
Basically, the initial screen of the user interface allows the user to log onto the application. You may assume that the application has access to relevant information about the user in a database. On the basis of the user status, the application brings up an appropriate screen; that is, showing a “search by category” screen for a user who is in one’s freshman or sophomore year, a “search by discipline” screen for other student users, or a “search by user-defined criteria” for administrative staff. Note that even though there is a primary search method for each group of users, other search methods should also be accessible to them. Here, the difference is that the primary method is automatically available, but extra effort may be required to gain access to other methods.
In this project, you will design an adaptable user interface for the annual class schedule application and create a low-fidelity prototype to demonstrate the major features of your design. Requirements for the intended application are as follows:

• Run on a mobile device with a small screen.
• Allow the user to search classes for one semester at a time. For prototyping purposes, consider several majors and a small number of classes in each major.
• Provide the user with easy and quick access to frequently performed tasks that are appropriate to the user status. Also makes it possible for the user to search information in other ways that are not automatically available.
• Allow a user to keep a list of classes that one has selected when using the application. In other words, while browsing classes, the user can select a class and add it to the list of classes. Then the user can view the list and remove classes from it as needed. Additional information about each class on the list includes the meeting time and location.
You can use any tool that you choose to create a user interface prototype. Your prototype does not need to be functional, but it must allow you to show key features of the user interface and engage users in usability testing.
Make a presentation in class on the date the project is due, which includes the following components:
• Describe three scenarios in which the user would use the application to accomplish a
task.
• Walk through the prototype to demonstrate how the user would interact with the
application via its user interface in each scenario.
• Discuss design decisions you made on the user interface and justify them.
